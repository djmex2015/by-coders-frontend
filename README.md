**Front-End**: Basically the implementation was done with Angular 13 (13.0.2) and I used Node.JS (16.13) as a development platform, also taking advantage of its very good support. If the site had a production environment, Apache would be a good option. I have also used other support libraries in CSS Material Angular, they have a good approval due to their compatibility with the framework.

To run the frontend it has to be run like this:

$ npm install //download app modules
$ npm start //starts the app

This will be displayed using the browser on port 4200 --> http://localhost:4200.

* The file that has to be loaded must follow the same standards as the CNAB.txt file to be well normalized/parsed.
